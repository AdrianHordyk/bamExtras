\title{Complete a length or age composition data frame so that all have desired dimensions. This is a modified version of comp_complete. The two functions should probably be combined with options to choose between sub-functions.}
\usage{
tseries_plot(
  x,
  err,
  errType = "sd",
  errStyle = "bands",
  errUnits = "SE",
  nErrUnits = 2,
  errLim = c(0, Inf),
  plotLabel = NULL,
  matplot_args = list(col = rainbow(ncol(x)), type = "o", lty = 1, lwd = 2, pch = 16,
    ylim = NULL),
  polygon_args = list(border = NA, lwd = matplot_args$lwd),
  col_band_alpha = 0.3,
  pt_buffer = 0.1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame of mean observations by year, where columns are different groups (e.g. fleets)}

\item{err}{error values for each value in x. Must be same dimensions as x}

\item{errType}{type of error provided: "cv"= coefficient of variation or "sd"=standard deviation. If "cv" then x is multiplied by err to compute sd.}

\item{errStyle}{Style of displaying error around the central tendency time series x. Can be"bars" or "bands"}

\item{errUnits}{Units of err. Used only for displaying text on plot (e.g. "SE")}

\item{nErrUnits}{Multiplied by err to determine how far above and below x to to plot the errors}

\item{errLim}{Range for limiting the plotting of error bars or bands.}

\item{plotLabel}{character string for labeling plot}

\item{matplot_args}{list of additional arguments passed to \code{matplot}, which plots x.}

\item{polygon_args}{list of additional arguments passed to \code{polygon}, which plots error bands when errStyle="bands".}

\item{col_band_alpha}{alpha (transparency) value between 0 and 1 to adjust opacity of color bands}

\item{...}{pass additional arguments to matplot}

\item{ylim}{range of y on plot}
}
